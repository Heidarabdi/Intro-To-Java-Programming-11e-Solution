## 关于本仓库

古圣人曰：“写代码不传github，如锦衣夜行”。今swy读Java而做题解，实功当代而利千秋也。夫swy初入代码门下，乃不知有py，无论java。懂王三年，江夏疫，余居家六月有几，会数据库原理需java之术，乃拜读梁博士之《Introduction to Java Programming》，醍醐灌顶。
或曰，“天不生java，代码万古如长夜”，诚哉斯言！然初入代码者，或挣扎于c之泥淖，或安乐于py脚本之奇技淫巧，java不传于大一新生，黄钟毁弃，瓦釜雷鸣。swy遂愤而做题解。

## how to run the code
To run the code, you must change the file name, since all of my main classes are named "book", which is incompatible to the file names. You may need Notepad++ or Emacs to open the file and copy the code. 
Some of the problems are too tedious for me to work on it, since my school work is really hard and I am tired of writing them.
If you have any questions, you can open an issue or email me. Good luck and have fun in the world of Java :P
